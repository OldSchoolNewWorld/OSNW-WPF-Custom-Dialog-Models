# OSNW-WPF-Custom-Dialog-Models
This repository has two distinct, but related, projects. One is a model to 
create a DLL containing one or more custom WPF dialogs. The other is a model to 
create a WPF application, or other assembly, that consumes a custom dialog in a 
DLL. The model application also includes a local custom dialog.

The dialog models can be found at 
[Models](https://github.com/OldSchoolNewWorld/OSNW-WPF-Custom-Dialog-Models/tree/master/Models).  
The consumer model can be found at 
[Consumer](https://github.com/OldSchoolNewWorld/OSNW-WPF-Custom-Dialog-Models/tree/master/Consumer).
